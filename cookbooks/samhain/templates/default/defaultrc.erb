# -- empty lines and lines starting with '#', ';' or '//' are ignored
# -- boolean options can be Yes/No or True/False or 1/0 
# -- you can PGP clearsign this file -- samhain will check (if compiled

# SETUP for file system checking:
# 
# (i)   There are several policies, each has its own section. Put files
#       into the section for the appropriate policy (see below).
# (ii)  Section [EventSeverity]: 
#       To each policy, you can assign a severity (further below).
# (iii) Section [Log]: 
#       To each log facility, you can assign a threshold severity. Only
#       reports with at least the threshold severity will be logged
#       to the respective facility (even further below).

# Files are defined with: file = /absolute/path
#
# Directories are defined with:                  dir = /absolute/path
# or with an optional recursion depth (N <= 99): dir = N/absolute/path
#
# Directory inodes are checked. If you only want to check files
# in a directory, but not the directory inode itself, use (e.g.):
#
# [ReadOnly]
# dir = /some/directory
# [IgnoreAll]
# file = /some/directory
#
# You can use shell-style globbing patterns, like: file = /path/foo*

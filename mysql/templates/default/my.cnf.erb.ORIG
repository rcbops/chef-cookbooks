### Rackspace MySQL 4.1/5.0 Verbose Configuration File v1.1
###
### This is a base configuration file containing the most frequently used 
### settings with reasonably defined default values for configuring and 
### tuning MySQL. Note that these settings can likely be further tuned 
### in order to get optimum performance from MySQL based upon the database 
### configuration and hardware platform.
###
### While the settings provided are likely sufficient for most situations, an 
### exhaustive list of settings (with descriptions) can be found at:
### 
### For MySQL 4.1:
### http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/4.1/en/server-system-variables.html
### For MySQL 5.0:
### http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/server-system-variables.html
###
### Further configuration file examples (with and without comments) can be
### found in @@@mysql_server_docdir@@@.
###
### Take care to only add/remove/change a setting if you are comfortable
### doing so! For Rackspace customers, if you have any questions or concerns,
### please contact the MySQL Database Services Team. Be aware that some work
### performed by this team can involve additional billable fees.

# Set this to force MySQL to use a particular engine / table-type
# for new tables. This setting can still be overridden by specifying
# the engine explicitly in the CREATE TABLE statement.
#default-storage-engine=InnoDB

# MyISAM
# ------

# Not sure what to set this to?
# Try running a 'du -sch /var/lib/mysql/*/*.MYI'
# This will give you a good estiamte on the size of all the MyISAM indexes.
# (The buffer may not need to set that high, however)
key_buffer_size=64M

# This setting controls the size of the buffer that is allocated when 
# sorting MyISAM indexes during a REPAIR TABLE or when creating indexes 
# with CREATE INDEX or ALTER TABLE.
myisam_sort_buffer_size=64M

# InnoDB
# ------
# Note: While most settings in MySQL can be set at run-time, InnoDB
# variables require restarting MySQL to apply.

# If the customer already has InnoDB tables and wants to change the 
# size of the InnoDB tablespace and InnoDB logs, then:
# 1. Run a full backup with mysqldump
# 2. Stop MySQL
# 3. Move current ibdata and ib_logfiles out of /var/lib/mysql
# 4. Uncomment the below innodb_data_file_path and innodb_log_file_size
# 5. Start MySQL (it will recreate new InnoDB files)
# 6. Restore data from backup
#innodb_data_file_path=ibdata1:2000M;ibdata2:10M:autoextend
#innodb_log_file_size=100M

# InnoDB loves RAM. For customers using mostly InnoDB, consider setting
# this variable somewhat liberally. Do make sure the server is 64-bit, 
# however, if you plan on setting it above 1.5-2GB.
innodb_buffer_pool_size=16M

#innodb_additional_mem_pool_size=20M

# innodb_file_per_table can be useful in certain cases
# but be aware that it does not scale well with a 
# large number of tables!
#innodb_file_per_table=1

# Somewhat equivalent to table_cache for InnoDB
# when using innodb_file_per_table.
#innodb_open_files=1024

# If you are not sure what to set this two, the
# following formula can offer up a rough idea:
# (number of cpus * number of disks * 2)
#innodb_thread_concurrency=16

# crashes and restarts, but can cause higher I/O on the server.
#sync_binlog=1

# If the server is a standard MySQL slave, it would be wise
# to enable read-only mode to prevent stray writes that could
# break replication
# read_only=1

# MySQL 5.0+ Only

# Do NOT uncomment these unless you know exactly what you are doing!
#auto_increment_increment=2

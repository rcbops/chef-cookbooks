## Description ##

This repository contains a collection of [chef](http://www.opscode.com/chef/) cookbooks  that can be used to deploy, and manage, the suite of OpenStack core projects (nova, glance, keystone, swift, horizon).  

The cookbooks have been designed and written in such a way that they can be used to deploy individual service components on _any_ of the nodes in the infrastructure; in short they can be used for single node 'all-in-one' installs (for testing), right up to multi/many node production installs.  

In order to achieve this flexibility, they make use of the [chef search](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Search)  functionality, and therefore require that if you are deploying anything larger than a single node deployment, you use [chef server](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Chef+Server) to host your cookbooks rather than using chef solo.  

## Cookbooks ##

Each of the cookbooks in the cookbooks directory is actually a [git submodule](http://help.github.com/submodules/), linking to an individual git repository where that cookbook is maintained.  

## Roles ##

There are a number of different chef roles that are included with these cookbooks.  Descriptions of each of the roles can be found in the [readme](https://github.com/rcbops/chef-cookbooks/blob/master/roles/README.md) in the roles directory.  

## Usage ##

##### getting the cookbooks #####

* clone the parent repository (note the `--recursive` flag - this will ensure that each of the repositories that the submodules point to is also cloned):

`git clone --recursive git@github.com:rcbops/chef-cookbooks.git`  

* upload your cookbooks and roles to your chef server( assuming  you have already [configured your knife client](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Fast+Start+Guide) with the credentials of your chef server:  

`cd chef-cookbooks`  
`knife cookbook upload -o cookbooks --all`  
`knife role from file roles/*.rb`

##### using the cookbooks #####

NOTE: You must use chef >= 0.10.12

Ensure you have [registered](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Cookbook+Fast+Start+Guide#CookbookFastStartGuide-Registeranodewithchefclient),  one or more nodes with your chef server.  Then use knife to assign roles to your nodes:

* for an all-in-one deployment of nova, using keystone and glance, on a node called node1:  

`knife node run_list add node1 role[allinone]`  

* for a 2 node deployment of nova, installing all nova controller functions, keystone and glance on node1, and setting node2 up as a compute server:  

`knife node run_list add node1 role[single-controller]`  
`knife node run_list add node2 role[single-compute]`  

* for a multi node deployment as above but with 'N' nova compute nodes  

`knife node run_list add node1 role[single-controller]`  
`knife node run_list add node2 role[single-compute]`  
`knife node run_list add node3 role[single-compute]`  
`...`  
`knife node run_list add node[n] role[single-compute]`  

* for a many node deployment with mysql and keystone on one node, nova core functions and horizon on another, glance on another, rabbitmq on another, and 'N' compute nodes:

`knife node run_list add node1 role[keystone]`  
`knife node run_list add node1 role[mysql-master]`  
`knife node run_list add node2 role[nova-controller]`  
`knife node run_list add node2 role[horizon-server]`  
`knife node run_list add node3 role[glance-api]`  
`knife node run_list add node3 role[glance-registry]`  
`knife node run_list add node4 role[rabbitmq-server]`  
`knife node run_list add node5 role[single-compute]`  
`knife node run_list add node6 role[single-compute]`  
`...`  
`knife node run_list add nodeN role[single-compute]`
